<h> 10 Things To Do When You Are Bored.</h>
<h1> by KATIE SWEENEY </h1>
<ol>
    <li> Go on a walk. Challenge yourself to leave your cell phone in your purse or pocket. Admire the view. Stop and smell the roses.</li> 
    <li> Organize something. Don’t tackle a huge organizational project like your closet. Instead choose something small and manageable—your underwear drawer, the spice cabinet in your kitchen, that overcrowded bookshelf—so you won’t be intimidated. Get rid of things.</li>
    <li>Read a book. I’m sure there is a book lying around your house that you’ve never read. Find it and read the first chapter. Or start that classic (The Great Gatsby, Pride & Prejudice, The Catcher in the Rye, etc.) you’ve been meaning to read forever.</li>
    <li>Try your hand at painting. Find a paint-by-numbers print you like, put your Picasso hat on, and start painting. When you are finished, give the painting to your mom or aunt as a gift.</li>
    <li> Meditate. Download a free app and follow along as you learn to be more in tune with your breathing, body, heart, and mind.</li>
    <li>Learn something new or something that you knew at one point but forgot. Use your Google skills to learn about the mating cycle of salmon, how to use Photoshop, the life of Oscar de la Renta, what the capitals of all 50 states are, or whatever else floats your fancy.</li>
    <li> Take a bubble bath. Why not? Let yourself relax! </li>
    <li> Make lists. List your goals, what you look for in a partner, dishes you want to learn how to make, clothes you’d like to buy for the spring season, places you’d like to visit, etc.</li>
    <li> Watch TV. It’s perfectly okay to unwind in front of the television. Plus, right now all of the best shows are returning after their winter breaks. </li>
  <li> Look through old family photos or yearbooks. Fondly remember the past.</li>
